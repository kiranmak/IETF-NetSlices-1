Network Slicing Concepts at IETF
Network Slicing is a coordinated and cooperative effort at IETF to arrive at common definition of Network Slcing, as it may be applicable to different types of networks encompassing Core, Aggregation, Transport and Access.

Such networks must work in tandem to deliver independently managed service assured network instances of partitioned infrastructure of network resources and functions.
